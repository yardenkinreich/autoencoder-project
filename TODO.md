To do list of additions/changes in code 
1. in display (maybe in train) as well change aggregating and averaging patch embeddins, to getting cls token  - did this - need to check it works (seems like it does)
2. Make cluster of danny images work for mae model (and plot images and plot dots) - seems like it does work
3. Change mae model from base to large - explain the different versions : changed to large, there is huge as well. 
4. In train instead of printing create timelog
5. Add timelog to other functions as well (display for example)
6. Update README
